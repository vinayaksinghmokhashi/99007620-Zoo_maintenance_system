## 1. ABSTRACT
Zoological parks provide an opportunity to open a whole new world of curiosity and interest, and sensitize visitors regarding the value and need for conservation of wildlife. 

## 2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
The main problem and motivation is basically lack of information about the various animals present in the zoo. This project is based on the various information related to the animal which are present in the zoo. Such as when we visit any zoo then we are not aware that which animal is placed at which place or we dont know the loci of that particular animal. To know this information, system looks for a data present in the zoo, but with this information system we can easily search the zoo by filling the name of the animal, such as Lion, Tiger, etc. then by running this user command one can easily find the block in which the animal is present.
